move the simulation to node
the simulation must take place in subprocess and message to controller when step is done
broadcast results of steps to the browser via websocket and display
use backbone only on client side

try to use three.js + tjQuery to display 3-d simulations

ask to get support for topological data analysis of simulated data
for this provide a web-service which can be used to get simulations for
different start-values in parallel
The measure of the analysis could be attractive sets, periodic orbits, 
chaotic behaviour
The idea is to use it when the model is very complex and a pure mathematical
treatment is time costly.
The system could be used to test models very quickly and getting from the
data analysis basic characteristics automatically
 
Important for this is to make trigger simulation via rest with differenct start-values and parameters applied
to the function.

One measure for the data analysis could be the Hausdorff distance between to simulations based on a set of 
start values and for different parameter.
The it is of interest if parameter-values have clusters which produce similar simulations (Hausdorff-distance is small 
between two in a cluster).

Data-analysis could be implemented in a separate R server which is invoked from node. And node serves the
simulated data to their via web-service.
